Hosting regular live Q&A sessions or webinars on trending data engineering topics could foster knowledge sharing, while a group repository of useful resources, such as tutorials, articles, and tools, would allow members to easily access information. Encouraging mentorship within the group, where experienced members offer guidance to those just starting out, could strengthen connections and boost learning. Additionally, engaging members through polls to gather feedback or determine areas of interest would ensure that discussions and content stay relevant.
